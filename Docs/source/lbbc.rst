The lattice Boltzmann boundary condition modules provide classes and methods to prepare model domains, supplied to LB-Colloids as .png images, for use in a lattice Boltzmann simulation. Before a lattice Boltzmann simulation can take place, it is necessary to convert the model domain imagery into a boolean representation of that media. The boolean conversion allows for easy recognition of pore-solid interface nodes and the representation of geometrically complex domains. Boundary layers can also be added to the upper and lower boundaries of the lattice Boltzmann model. Boundary layers are applied to reduce the potential development of local pressure maxima and compresssion effects due to periodic boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the system. Bounceback boundary conditions are applied to all other surfaces within the system.
