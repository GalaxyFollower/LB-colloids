Lattice Boltzmann input/output (*IO*) modules have been developed to facilitate end user functionality, such as reading configuration files and creating lattice Boltzmann fluid velocity images. The lattice Boltzmann IO module structure is a late addition to the project and is still in it's infancy, although the packaged code is completely stable. All lattice Boltzmann input and output read and write objects will  eventually be migrated to this set of modules.
