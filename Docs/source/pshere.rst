Penterable sphere has been developed to facilitate the automated generation of 2D synthetic porous media for lattice Boltzmann simulations and LB-Colloid particle tracking simulations. This utility has been included for the user that does not have access to thin sections of porous media to use as their simulation domain. Example usage is included in the following API documentation.
