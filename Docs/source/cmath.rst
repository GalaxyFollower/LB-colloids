The colloid mathematics module is responsible for calculating forces that define colloid-surface and colloid-colloid interactions. Objects exist within this module for each physical and physio-chemical interaction force that is simulated within a colloid particle tracking simulation. Forces are converted to a 'velocity-like' representation to account for the change in position due to applied forces. Calculations are performed for Brownian motion, drag forces, gravity, bouyancy, electrostatic repulsion, and attrative chemical interaction energies. A detailed review of the mathematical theory involved will not be described in this document. The base equations for each interaction are listed within the user documentation. The python version of colloid interactions will be migrated to FORTAN for computational efficiency. User functionality and object calls are not expected to change after migration.
