Colloid simulation input/output (*IO*) modules have been developed to facilitate end user functionality, such as reading configuration files, building configuration files with python, data processing, and visualization. Output modules have been developed for the user familiar with python. These modules include methods for reading HDF5 output, ascii output, performing statistical analysis on data, recovering macroscopic ADE parameters, and performing data visualization using the matplotlib library.
