The lattice Boltzmann permeability modules contain the principle methods and subroutines for simulating fluid flow within a model domain. Two possible programatic styles can be used for simulating lattice Boltzmann fluid domain models. The python "kernel" is primarily used for delevopment and debugging purposes. The default FORTRAN "kernel" provides a compiled version of this code, which is executes at speeds of approximately 100x faster than the python version. The FORTRAN code is dynamically compiled to the local machine upon installation of LB-Colloids. If FORTRAN compilation fails, it is reccomended that the user use the python kernel until the compiling issue is resolved. Documentation of the lattice Boltzmann permeability modules does not include documentation of the FORTRAN subroutines or the python mathematical code. For an understanding of the mathematics behind the lattice Boltzmann method an examination of source code and additional reading into lattice Boltzmann literature is required.
